<h3>Let's End The Trend</h3>
<p>From Carl Daikeler's Site, Published 26 November 2010</p>
<p>The trend in obesity is tragic. And while most admit the trend is only gaining in momentum, everyone agrees there is a solution; lifestyle change.</p>
<p><strong>How do you get 200 million people to eat better and exercise?</strong><br />
In 2007, Santa Monica-based Beachbody, LLC launched an innovation that uses a financial incentive to motivate people to make that lifestyle change. Beachbody is paying people – now over 42,000 people &#8211; to promote exercise and proper nutrition, starting with their own transformation and every additional success story they inspire.</p>
<p><strong>The most valuable question in weight loss: “How did you lose the weight?”</strong><br />
When a person loses weight, people notice and ask: “How did you do it?” That usually leads to a product recommendation. It is our belief that if your discipline to get healthy creates demand for our products, you should get paid for it. Now people can get paid for it, by becoming what we call a “Team Beachbody Coach.”</p>
<p><strong>Give everyone an incentive to promote a healthy lifestyle!</strong><br />
Our coaches are not fitness or nutrition experts. These are regular people who understand that the solution to obesity is exercise and proper nutrition. Beachbody simply added a financial incentive to adopt that healthy lifestyle and spread the word.</p>
<p>Healthy behavior is the basis for all Beachbody programs including P90X, Slim in 6, TurboJam, Body Gospel, Insanity and a breakthrough nutrition product called Shakeology. Coaches use the programs to get healthy, and people notice.</p>
<p><strong>An Unlimited Financial Incentive To Be Healthy?</strong><br />
The revolution that transforms these programs from top sellers into an end of the trend of obesity is the financial incentive to not just lose the weight, but keep it off and share the experience with others.</p>
<p>Team Beachbody Coaches are influencing the behavior of more people everyday by sharing their success on social media like Facebook and Twitter, holding community meetings to present the business and holding free weekly “fit clubs” in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>But what about the kids?</strong><br />
Each time a parent makes healthy food and fitness choices, the behavior of the household changes with them. Healthier food in smaller portions is served at the dinner table. Water replaces soda. Less time is spent in front of the TV. Kids are learning by example. They overhear their parents “selling” the value of a healthy lifestyle to prospects as they work to grow their Team Beachbody businesses.</p>
<p><strong>The end of the bake sale and the candy-drive</strong><br />
Non-profit organizations like churches, PTA’s, and other charities are using our business model to raise money in a way that actually improves the health and vitality of their constituents! Tables displaying Beachbody products and sign-up sheets inviting people to attend local fit clubs are replacing bake sales and candy drives.</p>
